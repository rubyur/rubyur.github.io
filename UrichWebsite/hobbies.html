I'm very bad at guitar, but it's still fun. I can play a few songs, but it's still fun.

I like messing with old macs, specifically powerpc ones. I share a collection with my brother, and we have too many to count. My favorite generation are the g3s, althought the picture is of an iMac g4. My iMac g3 is my pride and joy.

<p>
I like to go to the mall with my friends, although I don't buy much. Usually I just get food and hang out with my friends because I don't have much money or a job.
